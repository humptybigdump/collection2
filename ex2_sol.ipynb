    "## Exercise 2 a,b,c and d:\n",
    "This jupyter notebook offers a modular framework, where DFS, BFS and A star\n",
    "algorithms can be solved in a similar modality. Read the code carefully and\n",
    "fill in the missing steps of the function. Afterwards, when you run the code,\n",
    " the **result of task b, c, and d (6P)** will be shown automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed information:\n",
    "1. In script \"grid_world.py\", you can find the definition of the \"GridWorld\"\n",
    "and some helper functions regarding to the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In this notebook, a Node class which represents the data structure used in\n",
    "the search tree is offered. As the search procedure continues, the algorithm\n",
    "will keep expanding nodes of the tree into sub-trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In this notebook, two helper functions \"print_path\" and \"print_fringe_list\"\n",
    "are offered to help you print and understand the intermediate steps and final\n",
    "results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The function **\"pop_fringe_node\"** is to pop a node from the fringe list. In\n",
    "step 1, we gave an example of DFS method. **Please finish the BFS (1P) and A\n",
    "star (3P) in steps 2 and 3 respectively.** You should not modify other steps.\n",
    "Hints: you may need to call some basic python functions, such as: min() and\n",
    "index().\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The main search work is performed in function **\"search\"**. Given different\n",
    "arguments (\"dfs\", \"bfs\" or \"a_star\"), You can perform different search\n",
    "algorithm in a uniform way. The implementation of the search algorithm in\n",
    "this homework allows fringe list to store duplicated nodes referring to a same\n",
    "cell in GridWorld. When these nodes are \"poped up\" from the fringe list, only\n",
    "the first one can be expanded, while the rest of them will be skipped. (See\n",
    " lecture slide #81 in Search).\n",
    " **Please finish the step 9 of this function to expand a node, i.e. generate\n",
    " children nodes (10P in total).** You should consider these sub-steps in\n",
    " below (2P for each), while keep other steps unchanged:<br>\n",
    "    - Skip current node if it has been expanded before.\n",
    "    - In GridWorld, find neighbor cells of the cell referred by current node\n",
    "    (call function GridWorld.get_neighbors(...)). The children nodes to be\n",
    "    generated should refer to these neighbor cells.\n",
    "    - Skip constructing child node for a cell, if there was already an\n",
    "    expanded node refer to this cell.\n",
    "    - Call constructor to generate a child node. When doing this, you need to\n",
    "    decide the parent node, accumulated cost (g), and the cell it refers to.\n",
    "    - Update the \"expanded_list\" for current node, after all children nodes have\n",
    "     been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The pseudo-code of the entire search algorithm:\n",
    "    - Create an empty fringe list and initialize it with root node (refers to\n",
    "     Start).\n",
    "    - While the fringe list is not empty:<br>\n",
    "    -- Pop up a node from the fringe list according to the specific method.<br>\n",
    "    -- If that's a goal node, print the results and break the while loop.<br>\n",
    "    -- Otherwise, expand this node (if it is not expanded before), i.e. generate\n",
    "    and add children nodes for this node to the fringe list.<br>\n",
    "    - Return failure, if the node referring to Goal cannot be found after the\n",
    "    end of while loop."
