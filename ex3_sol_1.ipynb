    "This exercise was developed by Philipp Dahlinger for the KIT Cognitive Systems Lecture, Juli 2022. The pygame implementation of the snake environment was adapted from this source: [GitHub](https://github.com/jl4r1991/SnakeQlearning)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 3, a-f:\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook offers a framework of Approximate Q-learning with linear function approximation in the popular Snake game. Read the instructions carefully and complete the unfinished functions. Afterwards, you can run the training procedure and then verify your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. You may need to install pygame to run this notebook. Either you install it globally by opening a terminal and type in \"pip3 install -U pygame\" or you create a virtual environment (venv) and install pygame there. If you use a virtual environment, you may need to create a new kernel for the notebook. Detailled instructions for that can be found here: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33496350/execute-python-script-within-jupyter-notebook-using-a-specific-virtualenv).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In script \"snake.py\", you can find the definition of the \"Snake\" class.\n",
    "2. Keywords and rules of the game:\n",
    "    - **state**: A state is given by the positions of the snake elements on the screen (width: 30, height: 20) and by the food position. At the beginning of the episode, the game is initialized with a snake of length 1 and a random position of the food. Each time the snake head is at the same position as the food, the snake length and the score is increased by 1 and a new food spawns at a random location. <br>\n",
    "    - **action**: In every state, there are 4 possible actions, namely the direction where the snake head should move 1 space (up, right, down, left).  <br>\n",
    "    - **terminatation**: When the snake moves inside its tail or outside the screen, the game terminates. <br>\n",
    "    - **features**: Similar to the Tetris features in the Lecture Slides, we extract handcrafted features of the current state upon which the Q-values can be computed. The in total 6 features are the following:\n",
    "        - `pos_x`: If the food is right of the snake, this is 1. If the food is left of the snake, this is -1. If it has the same y-coordinate as the snake, this is 0.\n",
    "        - `pos_y`: If the food is below the snake, this is 1. If the food is above the snake, this is -1. If it has the same y-coordinate as the snake, this is 0.\n",
    "        - `surrounding`: Contains 4 entries. Each entry represents the space directly above, right, below or left to the snake head. If this space is occupied (either by the snake or a wall), this entry is 1, otherwise it is 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How to represent the Q-values**:\n",
    "    Given a state s, we will always have 4 Q-values $Q(s, a) \\in \\mathbb{R}$, one for each action. We represent them by a four dimensional vector and compute them with the formula\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$ Q(s) = \\phi(s) \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^4.$$\n",
    "Here, $\\phi(s) \\in \\mathbb{R}^6$ is the feature representation of the state. Our learnable weights $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6 \\times 4}$ is a matrix, where each row is responsible for the Q-value computation of 1 of the 4 actions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- 4. You can focus on the TD learning, and the action selection part, the\n",
    "remaining code is provided. If you are interested in the entire Tetris game with TD\n",
    "learning, please see the pseudo-code below:\n",
    "    - Initialize the game (Game UI, Environment etc.)<br>\n",

    "        - While the episode is not terminated<br>\n",
    "            - If there is no piece falling down:<br>\n",
    "                - next piece ->> current piece<br>\n",
    "                - Get a new next piece<br>          \n",
