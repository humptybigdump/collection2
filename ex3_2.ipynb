    "## Exercise 3, a-f:\n",
    "This jupyter notebook offers a framework of **Temporal Difference (TD) learning\n",
    " with linear function approximation** in a popular Tetris game. Read the\n",
    " instructions carefully and complete the unfinished functions. Afterwards,\n",
    " you can run the training procedure in Tetris game and then verify your\n",
    " implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed instructions:\n",
    "0. You may need to install pygame to run this notebook, e.g. open a terminal\n",
    "and type in \"pip3 install -U pygame\".<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In script \"tetris.py\", you can find the definition of the \"Tetris\" and\n",
    "some helper functions regarding the environment.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keywords in the game:\n",
    "    - **board**: The Tetris game board (width: 10, height: 20) in a board where\n",
    "     the game is played. At the beginning of the episode, the board is initialized as\n",
    "    a blank board. When the game is going on, the falling piece will be merged\n",
    "      into the board. When one or more lines in the board are completed, the\n",
    "      lines will disappear, and the player will gain some score.<br>\n",
    "    - **piece**: The Tetris game piece, which has 7 different shapes (S, Z, J,\n",
    "    L, I, O, T). Each piece is formed up with 4 boxes, and may show different\n",
    "     orientations by rotating. During the game play, each time a random piece\n",
    "      with random orientation is spawned on the middle top of the board. It\n",
    "      falls down one height level each time, and the player can apply an\n",
    "      action to it and put it in a desired place. In the meantime, the player can also\n",
    "       see the next incoming piece. When the current piece is placed on the bottom\n",
    "       line of the board, it will be merged into the board. Subsequently, the\n",
    "       next piece will show on the middle top of the board.<br>\n",
    "    - **action**: After a new piece is generated and before it is merged to the\n",
    "    board, a player can select an action to the piece to adjust its\n",
    "    placement. In contrast to the normal keyboard action (up, down, left,\n",
    "    right), the action used in this homework directly selects the final configuration\n",
    "    of the piece, which is described as a tuple **[rot, col]**. The rot is\n",
    "    the number of rotations to take, and col indicates the lateral movement\n",
    "    (left or right) to take. Once the action is given, it will be decomposed\n",
    "    into a series of keyboard \"pressing\" to execute the operation like a human\n",
    "    player. <br>\n",
    "    - **terminate** If the space of the middle top on the board is already\n",
    "    occupied and therefore the next new piece cannot be spawned, then the game\n",
    "   terminates.<br>\n",
    "    - **features** In the slides of Reinforcement Learning in Cognitive\n",
    "    Systems, 22 features (height of each column, diff between two columns,\n",
    "    max column height, number of holes, and 1 as constant) were introduced. To\n",
    "    make this homework simpler, however, a simplified feature vector\n",
    "    is used, which are **the average height of all columns; the summation of\n",
    "     absolute height differences of all columns; the number of holes in the board; and\n",
    "      a constant value 1** respectively. In the function \"get_features\" you can\n",
    "     see how the original 22 features are generated from the board, and in the\n",
    "     function \"get_simplified_features\", you can see how the simplified features are generated.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We assume that we have the deterministic system dynamics function $s' = f(s,\n",
    "a)$ for the Tetris game to predict the next state from the current state, and\n",
    " the action available, we will use a combination of TD-Learning for learning the\n",
    "  value function and 1-step look ahead prediction for action selection. For\n",
    "  TD-Learning, we will use the algorithm given in the lecture slides (page 27) to\n",
    "   the approximate case using linear function approximation. In order to arrive\n",
    "   at the approximate TD-Learning algorithm, follow exactly the same steps as for\n",
    "    deriving the approximate Q-Learning algorithm. For action selection we can\n",
    "    compute the Q-values using the learned V-function and the 1-step lookahead\n",
    "    prediction, i.e., $Q(s,a) = r(s,a) + \\gamma V_{\\beta}(f(s,a))$. The Tetris\n",
    "    class given below provides all functions to retrieve all possible actions for\n",
    "     the current state as well as to compute the next state given the current\n",
    "     state and action. Using the computed Q-values, the action should be selected\n",
    "      using an epsilon-greedy strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can focus on the TD learning, and the action selection part, the\n",
    "remaining code is provided. If you are interested in the entire Tetris game with TD\n",
    "learning, please see the pseudo-code below:\n",
